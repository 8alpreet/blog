I’m writing this for future me to remember just how scared and anxious I was at the beginning of all this. I’ve started and stopped the fast.ai course many times now, but this time has to be different. Whenever I pick a resource to start learning, I start to doubt my choice. My perfectionism kicks in and I start to think “Is this the right place to start?”, “Perhaps I should do Dataquest first, or maybe go through the ThinkStats book”. My challenge is not the material presented in a given resource, not that it’s entirely easy, rather my foe resides inside of me. This foe, this oppressive inner voice, doubts my ability to complete the fast.ai course, it doubts my ability to build my own projects, and it doubts my ability to be successful. This foe has continuously put me down throughout my college years, whenever I try to reason against this voice it constantly reminds me of my weakest moments but I have become wise through these years of defeat. I will no longer fight, rather I will simply make my choices and follow through without question, without trying to justify my choice to this voice. I will constantly remind myself that I do not have to be perfect, I don’t have to start at the perfect place, I simply have to start.

A bit about the quote above, I originally found it while doing research during my undergrad and it’s particularly aimed at scientists. I’m sure you can deduce it’s meaning, but I’ll explain it’s application in this context. The giant that the future me will be standing on is the present version of myself, I have to work hard to lay a strong foundation by building the knowledge which will allow future me to see further than I, the present I, ever could.
